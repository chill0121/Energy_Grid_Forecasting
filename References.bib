@article{Lai21,
	abstract = {Driven by the demand for intermittent power generation, Energy Storage (ES) will be widely adopted in future electricity grids to provide flexibility and resilience. Technically, there are two classes of ES for storing low-carbon energy: Generation-Integrated Energy Storage (GIES) and non-GIES. GIES stores energy along with the transformation between the primary energy form (e.g., thermal energy) and electricity. Long-term Electrical Power System Models (LEPSMs) support analysis including decarbonization studies and energy technology assessments. Current LEPSMs are limited in describing the power system with ES (e.g., considering one type of ES and not considering GIES). Consequently, a novel LEPSM is needed, and this paper paves the way towards this goal by bringing together the literature on ES and LEPSMs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of LEPSMs and shows that (a) existing models are inadequate to address grids with a high percentage of renewables and ES; and (b) there is a challenge in integrating short-term temporal changes in LEPSMs due to model complexity and computational cost. Finally, this paper proposes a framework for long-term electrical power system modeling considering ES and low-carbon power generation, which we have named the long-term power flow electrical power system framework. The key features of this novel framework are its agent-based modeling of consumer behavior, scenario reduction for renewables, and power flow analysis.},

@article{Hong16,
	abstract = {Load forecasting has been a fundamental business problem since the inception of the electric power industry. Over the past 100 plus years, both research efforts and industry practices in this area have focused primarily on point load forecasting. In the most recent decade, though, the increased market competition, aging infrastructure and renewable integration requirements mean that probabilistic load forecasting has become more and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This paper offers a tutorial review of probabilistic electric load forecasting, including notable techniques, methodologies and evaluation methods, and common misunderstandings. We also underline the need to invest in additional research, such as reproducible case studies, probabilistic load forecast evaluation and valuation, and a consideration of emerging technologies and energy policies in the probabilistic load forecasting process.},

@article{Weron14,
	abstract = {A variety of methods and ideas have been tried for electricity price forecasting (EPF) over the last 15 years, with varying degrees of success. This review article aims to explain the complexity of available solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats that the forecasting tools offer or that may be encountered. The paper also looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take in the next decade or so. In particular, it postulates the need for objective comparative EPF studies involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model's outperformance of another.},
