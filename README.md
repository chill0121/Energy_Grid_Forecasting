Energy forecasting is a vital part of today's energy markets and operations. It is used to set the cost of electricity, determine when power generation should be increased, and decide when power needs to be directed to or from other regions of the electrical grid. Electrical energy demand continues to rise, especially with the recent widespread adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. As a result, the electrical grid will need to become more robust and adaptive as this increase in demand comes in tandem with a transition away from fossil fuels and into a more diversified energy market and with it, more complex cycles. These circumstances make accurate forecasting and periodicity identification of electrical loads and generation that much more important, and it is necessary to research the differences in forecasting applications and relevance in various short-term, medium-term, and long-term settings.

Many of the statistical time series forecasting techniques of the past are still in use today, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, often trading compute efficiency with lesser accuracy in long-term forecast horizons or ability to capture multiple seasonal periods. More modern machine learning models and neural network-based architectures tend to generalize through forecasting horizons better, but often at great cost of compute resources making them inefficient for short forecast horizon forecasts. Though because of the potential for complexity of energy load patterns, both categories see benefits in task-specific tuning. By evaluating each forecasting model's accuracy across various context windows and forecasting horizons, this project presents a thorough comparison on which techniques are most relevant in the task-specific energy grid context and each forecast horizon.
