@article{Hua23,
	abstract = {Accurate and efficient load forecasting is of great significance for stable operation and scheduling of modern power systems. However, load data are usually nonlinear and non-stationary that make accurate forecasting difficult. Although some serial hybrid models effectively extracted the spatiotemporal features of load data, the extraction of features in order are not efficient due to the loss of some important features. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel ensemble framework for short-term load forecasting based on parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) with improved ResNet (iResNet). Firstly, the original data is preprocessed to reconstruct the electrical features. Secondly, the spatial and temporal features are extracted by the CNN and GRU, respectively. Then, both of the extracted features are dynamically combined with attention mechanism. Finally, the iResNet is utilized to efficiently forecast the power load. Compared with the GRU and serial CNN-GRU-iResNet models, the mean average percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed model decreases by 40% and 30%. The proposed model even outperforms the parallel CNN-LSTM-iResNet model by 12%, in terms of the MAPE.},

@inproceedings{Hopf23,
	abstract = {Forecasting electricity demand plays a critical role in ensuring reliable and cost-efficient operation of the electricity supply. With the global transition to distributed renewable energy sources and the electrification of heating and transportation, accurate load forecasts become even more important. While numerous empirical studies and a handful of review articles exist, there is surprisingly little quantitative analysis of the literature, most notably none that identifies the impact of factors on forecasting performance across the entirety of empirical studies. In this article, we therefore present a Meta-Regression Analysis (MRA) that examines factors that influence the accuracy of short-term electricity load forecasts. We use data from 421 forecast models published in 59 studies. While the grid level (esp. individual vs. aggregated vs. system), the forecast granularity, and the algorithms used seem to have a significant impact on the MAPE, bibliometric data, dataset sizes, and prediction horizon show no significant effect. We found the LSTM approach and a combination of neural networks with other approaches to be the best forecasting methods. The results help practitioners and researchers to make meaningful model choices. Yet, this paper calls for further MRA in the field of load forecasting to close the blind spots in research and practice of load forecasting.},

@article{Muzaffar19,
	abstract = {With the increasing load requirements and the sophistication of power stations, knowing in advance about the electrical load not only at short-term periods such as hours or couple of days but also over the longer-term periods such as weeks and months is indispensable for a range of benefits such as important technical and economic impacts. Traditional methods such as ARMA, SARIMA, and ARMAX have been used for decades. In recent years, the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as neural networks and deep learning are emerging in the field of time series analysis. Towards this end, the artificial neural networks (ANN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are being explored and have shown promises in much better forecasting as compared to traditional methods. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a special kind of RNN that have the capabilities to learn the long-term dependencies. In this work, we have picked up an electrical load data with exogenous variables including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The data is used to train the LSTM network. For a fair comparison, the data is also used in traditional methods to model the load time series. The trained LSTM network and the developed models are then used to forecast over the horizons of 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days and 30 days. The forecasts generated by the LSTM are compared with the results of traditional methods using RMSE and MAPE for all the forecast horizons. The results of a number of experiments show that the LSTM based forecast is better than other methods and have the potential to further improve the accuracies of forecasts.},

@article{Archsmith22,
	abstract = { Executive SummaryThis paper identifies and quantifies major determinants of future electric vehicle demand to inform widely held aspirations for market growth. Our model compares three channels that will affect electric vehicle market share in the United States from 2020 to 2035: intrinsic (no-subsidy) electric vehicle demand growth, net-of-subsidy electric vehicle cost declines (e.g., batteries), and government subsidies. Geographic variation in preferences for sedans and light trucks highlights the importance of viable electric vehicle alternatives to conventional light trucks; belief in climate change is highly correlated with electric vehicle adoption patterns; and the first \$500 billion in cumulative nationwide electric vehicle subsidies is associated a 7\%--10\% increase in electric vehicle market share in 2035, an effect that diminishes as subsidies increase. The rate of intrinsic demand growth dwarfs the impact of demand-side subsidies and battery cost declines, highlighting the importance of nonmonetary factors (e.g., charging infrastructure, product quality, and/or cultural acceptance) on electric vehicle demand. },

@article{Lai21,
	abstract = {Driven by the demand for intermittent power generation, Energy Storage (ES) will be widely adopted in future electricity grids to provide flexibility and resilience. Technically, there are two classes of ES for storing low-carbon energy: Generation-Integrated Energy Storage (GIES) and non-GIES. GIES stores energy along with the transformation between the primary energy form (e.g., thermal energy) and electricity. Long-term Electrical Power System Models (LEPSMs) support analysis including decarbonization studies and energy technology assessments. Current LEPSMs are limited in describing the power system with ES (e.g., considering one type of ES and not considering GIES). Consequently, a novel LEPSM is needed, and this paper paves the way towards this goal by bringing together the literature on ES and LEPSMs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of LEPSMs and shows that (a) existing models are inadequate to address grids with a high percentage of renewables and ES; and (b) there is a challenge in integrating short-term temporal changes in LEPSMs due to model complexity and computational cost. Finally, this paper proposes a framework for long-term electrical power system modeling considering ES and low-carbon power generation, which we have named the long-term power flow electrical power system framework. The key features of this novel framework are its agent-based modeling of consumer behavior, scenario reduction for renewables, and power flow analysis.},

	abstract = {Load forecasting has been a fundamental business problem since the inception of the electric power industry. Over the past 100 plus years, both research efforts and industry practices in this area have focused primarily on point load forecasting. In the most recent decade, though, the increased market competition, aging infrastructure and renewable integration requirements mean that probabilistic load forecasting has become more and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This paper offers a tutorial review of probabilistic electric load forecasting, including notable techniques, methodologies and evaluation methods, and common misunderstandings. We also underline the need to invest in additional research, such as reproducible case studies, probabilistic load forecast evaluation and valuation, and a consideration of emerging technologies and energy policies in the probabilistic load forecasting process.},
